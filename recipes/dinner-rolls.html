    <h4> These have become a FAVORITE between my girlfriend and I. They are so soft and smell so good halfway through the baking time til they hit the counter.
        They honestly have become more of the entree rather than the side with my soups, casseroles, or any meal I think a bread would pair
        nicely with. The first time I made these, I had TORCHED the tops because my oven waas too hot and they were nothing to brag about until I had revisitied them later on.

    <p> Ingredients:
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cup of whole milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
            <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp salt</li>
            <li>Around 3 tbsp of softened salted/unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>2 tsp active dry yeast</li>
            <li>3 1/2 cup of all purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
Directions:
        <ol>
            <li>Mix together the whole milk and water and heat to approximately 105°F.</li>
            <li>Add the yeast to the mixture with the sugar and allow the yeast to proof while covered 
                for at least 10 minutes or until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>While the yeast proofs, combine the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl.</li>
            <li>Combine the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients and stir until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
            <li>Flour your work surface and knead the dough until it becomes smooth and stops sticking you.
                 Do not be intimidated by the dough, flour your workspace until you can work the dough and 
                the dough is not working you!</li>
            <li>Add the first tbsp of your butter to the dough and work it in until it is smooth again</li>
            <li>Place the dough back into the bowl and cover with plastic wrap or a damp cloth. Let proof 
                for 1 hour or until doubled in size.</li>
            <li>After the dough has rested, punch down your dough and seperate into 8 (roughly) equal balls</li>
            <li>Grease a 9x13 casserole dish with another tbsp of butter</li>
            <li>Place your dough balls inside of the casserole dish, cover, and let them rise for 15 min</li>
            <li>After the dough balls have risen, make an eggwash with your 1 egg and brush the rolls on the tops and sides.
                Just don't use too much egg or you will have little crispies of egg somewhere on the rolls.
                 First time I made these I used like all my egg wash and got the egg ick.</li>
            <li>Bake the rolls at 350° for 20-22 minutes. My oven runs a little warmer because its an older model 
                so baking times may vary</li>
            <li>Take your rolls out and brush the tops with melted butter, I use 1 tbsp but fat carries flavor.
                Do with that information as you like. :)</li>
            <li>Optional: Add a small pinch of flaky salt to the tops of these for added flavor.</li>
            <li>Let the rolls cool but eat them while they are warm for optimal results!</li>
        </ol>
